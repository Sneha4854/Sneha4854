# Disaster Response System with WANET and Cloud

This project uses Wireless Ad-hoc Networking (WANET), cloud computing, and real-time data visualization to improve emergency response during disasters.

## Features:
- **WANET**: Decentralized communication without a central authority.
- **GPS & Accelerometer**: Detects disaster events (e.g., landslides).
- **Firebase**: Stores real-time data for accessibility.
- **Mobile App**: Visualizes disaster locations on a map for responders.

## Components:
- Client device with GPS and accelerometer.
- Server with Raspberry Pi, LCD, and LED.
- Firebase for data storage.
- MIT App Inventor for mobile app.

## How It Works:
The system detects disaster events, sends data through WANET, stores it in Firebase, and displays the location on a mobile app for responders.
